# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npx playwright test`

Runs the Playwright end-to-end tests. This command will execute the test files located in the `tests` directory. Make sure you have Playwright installed and configured (see `playwright.config.ts`).

Before running the tests, ensure the development server is running:
```sh
npm start
```
Then, in a separate terminal, run the Playwright tests:
```sh
npx playwright test
```

To see the test report:
```sh
npx playwright show-report
```
